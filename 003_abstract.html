            <span id="txt_espaco">.....</span>Computer networks, it was for me basically a resource for transferring files. From this, I learned a little more and now I think that in addition to my concept on the topic, the term “computer networks” itself is outdated, because today we see several devices that can connect to that computer network, even home appliances like a refrigerator for example. With the surprising evolution of computer networks, connectivity has become increasingly faster, stable and secure, allowing for the emergence of many advances in this segment, such as, for example, storage and cloud services, “IoT¹”, “AI²” for the time being the last two still hatch in Brazilian lands, but the world is experiencing an accelerated rise of the “internet of things¹” and of “artificial intelligence²”. Even with all the advances in technology, the core is still data communication.
